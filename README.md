===============

A game made in 48h for Global Game Jame 2014, by Freddy Ceranton, Corentin Derbre, Maxime Houlier.

Asymmetric local multiplayer cooperative anti criminal game (all this in the meantime):

2048. Standardization has become the rule, the law, the only alternative.
Crimes,terrorism have nearly disappeared thanks to anticipative repression.
An elite team ensures that civilians remain under control, for their own interests and for the interest of the collectivity.
This is achieved thanks to a formidable technique that comes from the latest psycho-cognitive improvements, the bi focus.
This technique is based on perception sharing between responsive subjects.
By focusing on set of people, the locker can feel their feelings and detect those who threaten the society. He doesnâ€™t see them as they are, but as he is. During this operation, the locker can become dangerous and unstable. Therefore, he remains far away from the population.
The shoother can concentrate on the thoughts of his partner and sense the subjects with bad intentions spread in the society. He remains able to take action. However, this concentration requires a huge effort that prevents him from seeing and perceiving the other people .

Bi Focus is a 2 local players game (split screen).
The game takes place in a public arena in the middle of the city.
You will experience multiple waves of passing by crowd.
For each wave, there is only ONE criminal hidding within the crowd.

One player has a "Look Out" role, and the other a "Trigger" role.
- The Look Out:
Located higher up, above the arena, he looks down towards the center of the arena. He can only move around the arena.
- The Trigger:
Located in the arena, he can move freely there. He is responsible for neutralizing the criminals.

Your goal, is to identify and neutralize the criminal (red) before the end of the wave, otherwise the criminal escapes.
Be careful not to neutralize a civilian (yellow).
